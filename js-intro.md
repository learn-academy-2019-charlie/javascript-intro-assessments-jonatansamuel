# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one? 
    
    - you would use a function to pass variables through a factory or funnel. A function is reusable
    you can always pass something through the function and it will always spit something out.

#### 2. What is a method?

    - is a function that belongs to a class.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
    
    - examples of JS string methods are commands like
    .push .pull console.log and they can allow for you 
    to manipulate a function.

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?

    - an acessory can allow you to temporarily change an array to display
    a desired output such as capitalizing all the letters in a string etc.
    - a mutator will permanently change an array. You would want to use this
    when you want to add or change the order of a set of strings or list.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?

    - console.log: can funnel commands through the parenthesis and change the outcome of the function.
    - return can only redirect a set of commands that already exist. by either returning some of the
    information or all of it depending on what the user inputs.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

    - hands on experience, working with various people helped me learn things through their 
    perspective and be able to absorb more knowledge.
